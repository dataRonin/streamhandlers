# streamhandlers
Simple test serve to yourself handler for data streams, specifically SSE and websockets with known json

Incoming data from vendors will be as HTTP SSE stream and websocket serving some JSON. Need to test that I can grab that data and see some kind of output. Not concerned with a formal architecture since these are temporary API's to last less than 1 week, but do not want to miss the data. Figured someone might want this code. Mostly taken from Stack Overflow answers and the migrating from Express 3 to 4 tutorial page, kluged together by the master of Kluge, me.
